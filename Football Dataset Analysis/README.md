## What is this project?
Football Dataset Analysis is a group project meant to study, analyse and extract information from the [kaggle football dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/secareanualin/football-events/home).


### What does Kaggle mean?
Kaggle, according to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaggle) "is an online community of data scientists and machine learners, owned by Google, Inc that allows users to find and publish data sets, explore and build models in a web-based data-science environment, work with other data scientists and machine learning engineers, and enter competitions to solve data science challenges."

### What is Football Dataset Analysis project about?
The project is aimed at studying the kaggle football dataset, to analyse, extract information from it and make predictions based on the data.

The main goal is to find the weaknesses and strengths of the team and assess the ways of measurement and improvement of the team performance

We got the most effective events and capitalised on their characteristics in order to achieve the set goal



**Examples of events used to determine the extent of the teams' weaknesses:**
1. Yellow and red cards served
2. Fouls against the team 
4. Shoots off target 
5. Penalty against the team 
6. Offsides
7. Shot place
8. Too high
9. High and wide
10. Goals against the team

**Examples of events used to determine the extent of the teams' strengths:**

1. Goals scored
2. Penalty
3. Cornes
4. Shoots on target
5. Shoots in bar
7. Shot_place
8. Location
9. Penalty spot
10. Very close range
11. Difficult angle and long range
12. Difficult angle on the left
13. Difficult angle on the right

**Below are the tasks we have accomplised:**

1.  Determined the probability of the team winning in a league 
2.  Determined the best combination of  players and strategies to increase the probability of winning
3.  Determined the players that make a great team based on features like attempts, strikes, assists, goals scored and so on
4.  Predicted the highly paid player based on performance in the teams and league at large.
5.  Predicted cards both yellow and red served to a team 
6.  Determined the effect of cards on the team's performance
7.  Found the relationship between receiving cards in the first half and performance in the second half.
8.  Determined the teams that are likely to attack from a given flank 
9.  Determined the correlation between strategies, ball possession and probabilility of winning.
10. Determined the qualitites that make a player crucial to the team's success
