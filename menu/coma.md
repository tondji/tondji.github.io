## Clinical applications: outcome prediction in coma patients

In our day-to-day lives, we are constantly immersed in streams of sensory information. Stimuli from our environment, like for example sounds, very often do not occur in a random way, but follow statistical rules and repetitive patterns. Thanks to these rules we are able to form expectations about future events, before these occur. I am interested in studying the neural and computational mechanisms that allow us to detect violations of anticipated events, in relation to our levels of [consciousness](https://academic.oup.com/brain/article/138/5/1160/406045/Neural-detection-of-complex-sound-sequences-in-the), [attention](http://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/abs/10.1162/jocn_a_00835?journalCode=jocn), or complexity of the environment.

In particular, in previous work we have used multivariate EEG decoding techniques to show, that patients who are deeply unconscious can detect at a neural level, violations of [simple rules](https://academic.oup.com/brain/article/136/1/81/430538/Progression-of-auditory-discrimination-based-on) and [complex sound sequences](https://academic.oup.com/brain/article/138/5/1160/406045/Neural-detection-of-complex-sound-sequences-in-the).

## Computational and machine learning applications

Studying neural responses to environmental stimuli through electroencephalography (EEG), typically requires averaging hundrents or thousands of single-trial responses, and contrasting them at single electrode locations. During my PhD, I used multivariate techniques to model the distribution of single-trial EEG responses across the scalp, and extract topographic EEG responses in a data-driven way. This technique can be used to model data at the [single-patient](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165027014003872) level, to decode [decisions from EEG responses](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053811912001632), or to test the role of [temporal intervals in processing environmental stimuli](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053811912001589).
