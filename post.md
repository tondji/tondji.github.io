# Machine Learning Courses
---

If you are beginner in Machine Learning and you want to get a solid mathematical background in order to do Machine learning, this is a list of very good books that I used myself : 
* [Mathematics for Machine Learning](https://mml-book.com). by [Marc Peter Deisenroth](https://twitter.com/mpd37), [A Aldo Faisal](https://twitter.com/analogaldo), and [Cheng Soon Ong](https://twitter.com/ChengSoonOng).
The book is not intended to cover advanced machine learning techniques because there are already plenty of books doing this. Instead, is to provide the necessary mathematical skills to read those other books.
* [Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/cmbishop/#!prml-book) by [Christopher Bishop](https://twitter.com/ChrisBishopMSFT).
* Machine Learning: A Probabilistic Perspective by **Kevin P. Murphy.**
* [Understanding Machine Learning From Theory to Algorithms](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&ved=2ahUKEwio5s3M86zfAhXqxoUKHXm7A_oQFjAAegQIAxAC&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cs.huji.ac.il%2F~shais%2FUnderstandingMachineLearning%2Funderstanding-machine-learning-theory-algorithms.pdf&usg=AOvVaw3w_XtL2On_1VFSyDmcU0Qn) by **Shai Shalev-Shwartz** and **Shai Ben-David.**

# Deep Learning Courses
---

* You can find here [slides](https://fleuret.org/ammi-2018/) and a virtual machine for an introductory course to deep learning given in the African Master’s of Machine Intelligence at AIMS by [François Fleuret](https://www.idiap.ch/~fleuret/). This course covers the main deep learning tools and theoretical results, with examples in the PyTorch framework.
* Mini Course in [Deep Learning with PyTorch](https://github.com/Atcold/pytorch-Deep-Learning-Minicourse) for AIMS given by **Alfredo Canziani and Ritchie**.
