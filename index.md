I am currently undergoing the African Masters in Machine Intelligence [(AMMI)](http://aims-ammi.com/) by AIMS in patnership with Facebook and Google based in Kigali, Rwanda.
Before that I graduated from [AIMS- Senegal](https://www.aims-senegal.org/) in February 2018 with a Master degree in Mathematical science where my Master Thesis was on [*Web Recommendation systems for jobs seekers and recruiters*](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=NEBFZl8AAAAJ&hl=en) and it is available on Google scholar.
I am passionate about Theoretical Deep learning with applications in Visual Recognition, Reinforcement Learning and some stuffs related to Gaussian processes.

## Machine Learning Tutorials
Very soon , I will be posting some tutorials on machine learning and deep learning for dummies for those who are new in the field. Stay tuned  on my blog. But for now you can have a look at samples of some codes [here](https://github.com/tondji/tondji.github.io/tree/master/Machine-Learning-Codes) that I did for my assignments at AMMI for the first semester. That part is most about Foundations of Machine Learning.

## Deep Learning Tutorials
For deep learning Tutorials, you can have a look at sample of my deep learning code that I did for my coursework during the first semester [here](https://github.com/tondji/tondji.github.io/tree/master/Deep-Learning-Codes)

## Reinforcement Learning Tutorials
For deep learning Tutorials, you can have a look at sample of my reinforcement learning basic code that I did for Q-Learning Algorithm [here](Reinforcement-Learning/Reinforcement+Learning+-Intro-to-Q-Learning.html) or for more codes you can have a look at samples of some codes [here](https://github.com/tondji/tondji.github.io/tree/master/Reinforcement-Learning)
