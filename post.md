If you are beginner in Machine Learning and you want to get a solid mathematical background in order to do Machine learning, this is a list of very good books that I used myself : 
* [Mathematics for Machine Learning](https://mml-book.com). by [Marc Peter Deisenroth](https://twitter.com/mpd37), [A Aldo Faisal](https://twitter.com/analogaldo), and [Cheng Soon Ong](https://twitter.com/ChengSoonOng).
The book is not intended to cover advanced machine learning techniques because there are already plenty of books doing this. Instead, we aim to provide the necessary mathematical skills to read those other books.
* [Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/cmbishop/#!prml-book) by [Christopher Bishop](https://twitter.com/ChrisBishopMSFT).
* Machine Learning: A Probabilistic Perspective by Kevin P. Murphy.



We aim to keep this book fairly short (tried for 300 pages, now close to 400 pages),
so we don't cover everything.

**We will keep PDFs of this book freely available after publication.**
