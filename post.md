If you are beginner in Machine Learning and you want to get a solid mathematical background in order to do Machine learning, this is a list of very good books that I used myself : 
* [Mathematics for Machine Learning](https://mml-book.com). by [Marc Peter Deisenroth](https://twitter.com/mpd37), [A Aldo Faisal](https://twitter.com/analogaldo), and [Cheng Soon Ong](https://twitter.com/ChengSoonOng).
The book is not intended to cover advanced machine learning techniques because there are already plenty of books doing this. Instead, the aim of their Book is to provide the necessary mathematical skills to read those other books.
* [Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/cmbishop/#!prml-book) by [Christopher Bishop](https://twitter.com/ChrisBishopMSFT).
* Machine Learning: A Probabilistic Perspective by Kevin P. Murphy.
